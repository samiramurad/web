<h1>Books You Should Consider Adding To Your Library</h1>

<h2>About this site</h2>
<body> 
<p>
This site is a great way to discover new books to add to your library. This site consists of several great reads. If you enjoy reading, I highly recommend looking through this website; maybe you will discover a new adventure. If you are anything like me, you may love to read but struggle to find the best books for you. Books tend to only have a short, vague summary, if even that, that does not really tell you what the story is about. This site is a great way to learn about a few amazing stories with a little more information before actually committing.
