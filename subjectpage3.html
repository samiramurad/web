<h2>"The Fault In Our Stars" by John Green</h2>
<p>
"The Fault in Our Stars" is a book about love, loss, and how far you would be willing to go for your loved ones. Hazel has terminal cancer and she knows she's going to die. Her mother makes her attend a cancer support group in the basement of a church, where she meets Augustus Waters. Augustus and her become friends, and eventually fall in love. Augustus is in remission from his cancer, and he knows Hazel will die. Hazel and him spend a lot of their time with each other, and Hazel tells him about her one true wish. In a surprising turn of events, Augustus makes her wish come true, because he loves her. This is a sad and beautiful tale about two people in love while coming to terms with their realities and bracing themselves for loss.
