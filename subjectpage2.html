<p>
     "The Science of Breakable Things" is a story about awareness, friendship, and coping with reality. Natalie has a loving father and mother. Natalie had always been close to her mother, until her mother was diagnosed with depression and did not want to get out of bed anymore. Natalie rarely saw her mother anymore and she missed her. Natalie's mother was a botanist before she left her job and she loved flowers. Natalie misses her mother and wants her to be herself, so she goes on a quest to get enough money to fly her and her mother to see rare flowers, in the hopes that it would help her out of her depression. This is perfect since the science fair is coming up, with the winning prize being cash. So Natalie teams up with her best friend, Twig, and a kid she does not know very well, Dari, to complete her quest. This book spreads awareness about depression and it has so many great moments.
